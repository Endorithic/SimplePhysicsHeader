# Simple Physics Header - Documentation
---
## Overview
This header-only file is designed with a single goal in mind. Make designing physics related function easier and faster.  
The code is designed to allow for as much as possible of the calculation to be done at compile time.  
The header has a dedicated namespace, `SI::*`.

## Current Features
- Support for all the 7 fundamental SI units.
- Support for deriving units from fundamental units using standard arithmetic.
- Support for constexpr calculations of values.

## Requirements
- Compiler with
